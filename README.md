# TrainTimes

### UCF Boot Camp 

Instructions: 

In this assignment, I needed to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The Train Times app can retrieve the data from the user, including the train's initial departure time and its frequency, and use that data to calculate when the next train will arrive.
