# TrainTimes

### UCF Boot Camp 

Instructions: 

In this assignment, I needed to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app can retrieve the data from the database and use it to calculate when a train will arrive, based on it's original departure time and frequency.
